提示可以大幅提升性能，解决库现有的局限性。

### 1.具体与开放式

** ✅ 具体（推荐）**
```python
task = """
1. 去 https://quotes.toscrape.com/
2. 使用抽取作，查询“前3句引语及其作者”
3. 通过write_file动作保存结果quotes.csv
4. 在谷歌上搜索第一句名言，找到它写作的时间
"""
```

**❌ Open-Ended**
```python
task = "Go to web and make money"
```

### 2. Name Actions Directly

When you know exactly what the agent should do, reference actions by name:

```python
task = """
1. Use search action to find "Python tutorials"
2. Use click to open first result in a new tab
3. Use scroll action to scroll down 2 pages
4. Use extract to extract the names of the first 5 items
5. Wait for 2 seconds if the page is not loaded, refresh it and wait 10 sec
6. Use send_keys action with "Tab Tab ArrowDown Enter"
"""
```

See [Available Tools](/customize/tools/available) for the complete list of actions.


### 3. Handle interaction problems via keyboard navigation

Sometimes buttons can't be clicked (you found a bug in the library - open an issue). 
Good news - often you can work around it with keyboard navigation!

```python
task = """
If the submit button cannot be clicked:
1. Use send_keys action with "Tab Tab Enter" to navigate and activate
2. Or use send_keys with "ArrowDown ArrowDown Enter" for form submission
"""
```




### 4. Custom Actions Integration

```python
# When you have custom actions
@controller.action("Get 2FA code from authenticator app")
async def get_2fa_code():
    # Your implementation
    pass

task = """
Login with 2FA:
1. Enter username/password
2. When prompted for 2FA, use get_2fa_code action
3. NEVER try to extract 2FA codes from the page manually
4. ALWAYS use the get_2fa_code action for authentication codes
"""
```

### 5. Error Recovery

```python
task = """
Robust data extraction:
1. Go to openai.com to find their CEO
2. If navigation fails due to anti-bot protection:
   - Use google search to find the CEO
3. If page times out, use go_back and try alternative approach
"""
```



The key to effective prompting is being specific about actions.
